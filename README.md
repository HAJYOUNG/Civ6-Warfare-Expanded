# Civ6-Warfare-Expanded

# What's this github for?
GitHub is the best free way for a team of people to work together on a programming project in a transparent and organized way. The files for this mod are hosted here at GitHub so that anyone can easily make suggestions, fix bugs, or provide translations. If you're new to GitHub, here are the basics:

# How can I get the latest Data/Text files and put them into my mod?

1) Go here: https://github.com/dbergan/WarfareExpanded
2) Click the Green "Clone or Download" button
3) Download ZIP
4) Extract the zip into a folder
5) There should be two folders in there (Data and Text), Copy/Paste these folders into your WarfareExpanded folder and overwrite the existing files

My WarfareExpanded folder is here, yours may be in a slightly different location.

# How do I suggesting a complex change?

1) You will need a github account. Create one here:
https://github.com/join

2) Once it's created and you've logged into github, go here: https://github.com/dbergan/WarfareExpanded

3) Click the Fork icon in the top-right area of the page. What this does is copy all of the files from the master codepage into your own personal directory. Once you clicked that button, you'll notice in the top-left that it will say "MyUserName / WarfareExpanded" now instead of "dbergan / WarfareExpanded". You'll see the same change in the URL "https://github.com/MyUserName/WarfareExpanded".

4) Now you can edit any of the files that you want. Whatever you edit does not change the master codepage, just your own personal Fork. You edit files by clicking, for example, Text >> en_US >> WarfareExpanded_Text.xml to bring up the file you want. And then click the pencil icon (top-right of the code section) to make the code section editable. When you're done editing, fill out the description title at the bottom of the code section and click the green "Commit changes".

5) Keep doing this until you've edited all the files that you need to. At any point in the process you can test your edits by clicking the "<> Code" tab and following the instructions from Step 2 onward in the comment below about getting the latest Data/Text files.

6) Once you're sure that you have all the changes you want to make, You create a "Pull Request"... this means that you want the master codepage to "pull" your changes into it. To do this, you click the "<> Code" tab and then click the button on the left side next to Branch: master that says "New pull request".

7) On this next page, it should show all the differences between your Fork and the master codepage. If it looks good, click the green "Create pull request" button, then write a description of your changes, and again the green "Create pull request" button.

That's it! We automatically get a notification of the pull request and will merge it in at our convenience. If we have any questions, we'll let you know.
